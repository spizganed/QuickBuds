# CLAUDE.md — working notes for this project

**Read this before touching anything.** It carries the state that is not derivable from the code:
the toolchain, the conventions, the mistakes already paid for, and what is currently open.

## What this project is

**QuickBuds** — an Android app that controls OnePlus / OPPO / realme earbuds directly over classic
Bluetooth **RFCOMM**, with no HeyMelody, no vendor app, no root, no Shizuku, no ADB. Kotlin.

- Package `com.spizganed.quickbuds` (final). App name **QuickBuds**. GitHub: `spizganed/QuickBuds`,
  branch `main`.
- License **GPL-3.0**. Test device: **OnePlus Buds 4** on a **Nothing Phone (3a), Android 15**.
- Single module, `:app`. All sources are Kotlin under `app/src/main/kotlin/`; no Java.

**The north star is parity with HeyMelody**, then this project's own improvements on top (the widget,
the wear-state display). Only after that, other earbud models.

## Read order

The PC move is done — build confirmed working, wrapper generated, device reachable — as of
2026-09-20. `START-HERE.md` and `DeepSeek_CodeAssist_memory.md` served their purpose and are gone;
this file is now the sole entry point for a new session.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) | The plan: what is next, in order, and what is done or undecided. |
| [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) | **The wire format, end to end.** Read before any protocol work. |
| [README.md](./README.md) | The accurate feature summary. |
| [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md) | Whose reverse-engineering this stands on. Add a row when you add a constant. |
| [PACKET-CAPTURE.md](./PACKET-CAPTURE.md) | How to capture a packet log, kept as a backup procedure. |

## Build and run

Plain desktop Gradle. There are no CodeAssist prerequisites or dependencies any more.

- **Toolchain:** Gradle **8.13** · Android Gradle Plugin **8.13.0** · Kotlin **2.4.0**
- **SDK levels:** `compileSdk 36`, `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 35`, Java 8
- **Only dependency:** `androidx.core:core:1.13.1`
- `./gradlew assembleDebug` → `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` — **use this one.** There
  is no signing config, so a release build comes out unsigned and will not install (see *Signing*).
- `./gradlew assembleRelease` → `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`
- `./gradlew bundleRelease` → `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- Deploy with `adb install -r <apk>`. **adb over USB is the debugging path**; use `adb logcat` for
  anything the in-app logs do not show.
- **Wireless adb also works, confirmed 2026-09-22** — used to pull an `adb bugreport` for a
  Wireshark/tshark capture with no cable. Phone: Developer options → Wireless debugging → "Pair
  device with pairing code" gives an `IP:port` + 6-digit code; `adb pair <that ip:port> <code>`
  (code is one-shot and expires in well under a minute, so run the pair command immediately after
  reading it off screen — a stale code fails as `protocol fault (couldn't read status message)`,
  which looks like a network problem but usually isn't one). Then `adb connect` the **different**
  `IP:port` shown on the main Wireless debugging screen (not the pairing one) to actually attach.
  Phone and PC do not need to be on the same LAN in the traditional sense — this was verified over a
  Tailscale link (a `100.64.0.0/10` address), so a VPN mesh between them is enough as long as the
  pairing/connect ports are reachable.
- `local.properties` must contain `sdk.dir=...`; it is git-ignored and must not be committed.

### Environment you need

Everything below is a one-time PC setup. Nothing here was recorded anywhere before the move,
because the phone side had it all built in.

| Need | Version / note |
|---|---|
| JDK | **17 through 23** — required by AGP 8.13, but **Gradle 8.13 itself rejects JDK 24+** outright (fails with the bare version number as the error, e.g. `25.0.3`, no other message). Set `JAVA_HOME` to something in range. See the JDK note below if running from Android Studio. |
| Android SDK | `platforms;android-36` (for `compileSdk 36`) and `platform-tools` (for adb). `build-tools` matching AGP. |
| Gradle | Only to generate the wrapper (below). After that `./gradlew` is self-sufficient. |
| adb | For deploying to the phone and reading `logcat`. |
| kotlin-stdlib | **No** manual install — it comes with the Kotlin Gradle plugin. The only app dependency is `androidx.core:core:1.13.1`. |

### First run on the PC

The build files are committed, but **the wrapper scripts are not yet generated** — this project
never had a `gradlew` (CodeAssist drove the build itself), so the first step on the PC is to create
them once:

```bash
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.13     # writes gradlew, gradlew.bat, gradle-wrapper.jar
./gradlew assembleDebug                  # first real build
```

Set `sdk.dir` in a local `local.properties` (or export `ANDROID_HOME`). `local.properties` is
git-ignored — never commit it.

The wrapper JAR and scripts **should be committed** afterwards, so nobody needs a local Gradle
install or a matching Gradle version again. **Commit them as a follow-up, and note in the commit
that they are generated.** They are the one piece of the build that is not yet in the repo.

**The first build also downloads a lot** — Gradle 8.13, AGP, and the Kotlin plugin. That is expected,
not a stall.

**Expect a Kotlin-metadata warning on the first build.** Kotlin 2.4.0 is newer than the D8/R8 that
AGP 8.13.0 bundles, which warns that it cannot rewrite the newer metadata. It is a warning, not an
error — the build succeeds. Raising the AGP version clears it.

**JDK gotcha, found 2026-09-20 setting this up in Android Studio's own agent terminal:** Android
Studio's *own* bundled JBR can be too new for Gradle 8.13 — this machine's was JDK 25, and running
`gradle wrapper` with it failed with just `25.0.3` as the error, no other detail. Android Studio also
keeps a **second, older JBR** at `~/.jdks/jbr-<version>` (this machine had `jbr-21.0.11`) — that's the
one Studio itself uses as the *project* JDK for Gradle sync, separate from the IDE's own runtime.
Point `JAVA_HOME` at that one, not the IDE's bundled JBR, if the IDE's own JBR turns out to be JDK 24+.

**Android Studio's own sync may have already done most of this setup for you** — check before
reinstalling anything. On the machine this was verified on, Studio's sync had already: written a
correct `local.properties`, installed the matching SDK platform/build-tools, and even pre-downloaded
the exact Gradle 8.13 distribution into `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/`, which can be pointed at directly
(`<dist>/gradle-8.13/bin/gradle.bat wrapper --gradle-version 8.13`) to generate the wrapper without
any network access at all.

`app/module.toml` and `.platform/` — CodeAssist's project model and cache/settings from the mobile
era — are git-ignored and were never committed, so **a fresh clone on the PC will never have them at
all.** They only ever existed on the original phone's working copy, which was intentionally left
alone during the move so the phone build kept working as a fallback. If you're working from a fresh
clone, there is nothing here to clean up — this note is historical, kept only so nobody goes looking
for files that were correctly never carried across git.

### Signing — there is none

There is **no release signing config** and no keystore in the project — the developer has decided
not to sign yet, and sideloaded installs simply raise the usual "unknown app" / Play Protect
warning on first install. Do not add a keystore without being asked.

**This is the first thing that will bite on the PC.** The CodeAssist build signed its output
in-process, so `androidRun:app:release` produced an installable APK. Plain Gradle does not: with no
`signingConfig`, `./gradlew assembleRelease` emits **`app-release-unsigned.apk`, which Android will
refuse to install**. Until a keystore exists, build and deploy with the **debug** variant
(`./gradlew assembleDebug`, or `assembleRelease` only once a signing config is added) — do not
report "the release APK is fine" without checking that it is signed.

When signing is eventually set up: the key must be kept, because **the in-app updater can only
install over an app signed with the same key**. Losing it means every installed copy has to be
uninstalled first.

### Versioning — the manifest is the single source of truth

`versionCode` / `versionName` are declared **only** in
`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` on `<application>`. `app/build.gradle.kts` deliberately does
**not** set them (see the comment there), so there is exactly one place to edit and nothing to keep
in step.

This is a fix, not a preference. On the mobile setup the version was declared twice — in
`app/module.toml` (CodeAssist's project model, now retired and not in the repo) and in the manifest
— and the two drifted apart:

- v1.0.0 declared **no version at all**.
- A later build put **0.4.0 in the manifest** while `module.toml` said `1.0`, so the installed app
  reported 0.4.0 while the release was tagged 1.0.0.

**Current: versionCode 2 / versionName 1.1.0.** Verify what actually ships in
`app/build/intermediates/android/release/merged-manifest/AndroidManifest.xml`, not in a source file.
`UpdateActivity` reads the installed version through `PackageManager`, deliberately, because the
generated build script did not always emit a `BuildConfig` (and `buildConfig` is still off — see
`app/build.gradle.kts`).

### Release flow

The in-app updater (`UpdateActivity`) compares the **GitHub release tag** against the installed
version and requires an **`.apk` asset** on the release. A `.aab` alone is invisible to it, so an
APK must be attached as well. v1.1.0 is live with `QuickBuds1.1.0.apk` attached.

## History: mobile → PC

Everything up to and including **v1.1.0** (commit `2875262`) was written on a **mobile-only
workflow** — Nothing Phone (3a), CodeAssist IDE, Termux, GitHub mobile. Work has since moved to
**Claude Code on a PC**, with Gradle and adb. Attribution: DeepSeek chat (~15% — first codebase,
first RE steps), the CodeAssist agent via OpenRouter on DeepSeek v4.1-fast (~80% of the current
code), Kimi / Gemini / Grok for small tasks, then Claude Code from here on.

**Some habits below are CodeAssist artefacts. They are marked, and they do not apply on PC.**

## Protocol work — the rules that were paid for

Use [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) as the reference; it tags every claim `[VENDOR]` / `[OSS]` /
`[CAPTURE]` / `[GUESS]`. The short version of what bites:

- **Never guess a payload.** Confirming a read is cheap; a guessed write to the buds fails
  silently. This is the single most expensive mistake in the project's history — see PROTOCOL.md's
  "History of Getting This Wrong".
- **The SET and NOTIFY ANC encodings are different tables** and are not supposed to agree.
- **Adaptive's SET mask is `0x0800` (bit 11), not bit 8.** Its payload is `01 01 00 08`. The value
  `8` produced `01 01 00 01`, a different mode. Derive an index from the mask, never from a mode's
  position in the vendor's list.
- **`0x01F0` / `0x01F2` are not commands.** They are the command byte welded to its SEQ value. The
  real numbers are **`0x0106`** (battery) and **`0x0109`** (wearing). Searching logs for `0x01F0`
  finds nothing because no such command exists.
- **`0x0205`'s payload is count-first**, ids after: `[count][eventId...]`. `01 01 02 02` is a
  misread — it means "count=1, battery only", which the firmware ACKs while silently never pushing
  wear. **The app sends `03 01 02 03`** — count=3, then battery `01`, wearing `02`, **ANC `03`**
  (`OpoProtocol.registerNotifications()`). Omitting `03` makes bud-side ANC gestures look silent,
  which is exactly how that bug hid for three captures. Never shorten this list.
- **The gesture write is `0x0401`, not `0x0402`.** `0x0402` is ignored in total silence and cost a
  session. **A wrong command number fails silently**, which is why every gesture write re-reads the
  table and diffs it.
- **`TotalLen` is LEB128.** All frames the app builds today are under 127 bytes so a single-byte
  writer is correct, but `OpoProtocol.buildPacket()` does not implement real LEB128 — a much larger
  key-function table would need it.
- **Payload always starts at byte index 9** (`BudsConnectionManager.payloadOf()`).

### Gesture configuration (the newest, most delicate code)

- The `function` values are **MEASURED, not guessed** — see `GestureAction.functionByte` and
  PROTOCOL.md §6. **Do not re-derive them**; a previous session declared the theory refuted on the
  strength of one frame that turned out not to be the same kind of event at all.
- **`writeGestureBinding(side, ...)` takes NO button list from our code.** It writes every slot the
  bud actually has for that action, excluding only the `BUTTON_ON_CALL_GUESS` (`0x06`) group.
  **Never reintroduce a hardcoded button group** — the bud's slot layout differs per bud and
  normalises itself between writes, so any fixed group is wrong about half the time. This broke
  slide twice, in opposite directions.
- `KeyFunctionParser.HEADER_SIZE = 2` — the reply is `<status> <count> <entries>`. The OSS source
  models one entry, not the envelope, and taking `payload[0]` as the count cost an off-by-one.
- **The hold's function byte does not control the ANC cycle.** Clearing it to `0x00` does not stop
  the cycle. The cycle's membership is a *separate* command, `setSupportNoiseReduction`
  (`0x0404`), read back with `0x010C` payloads `02 01` / `02 03` / `02 04`. Not wired yet.
- Baseline for the diff is persisted in its own prefs (`QuickBudsKeyFnDiff`) because the experiment
  needs a reconnect that can restart the process. **An empty reply must never overwrite a good
  baseline.**
- The reply is printed in three places, so a capture is readable even if the parse is wrong: the raw
  `RX:` line, `BudsConnectionManager`'s `KEYFN:` line, and `LogDecoder` — **all end with `RAW=[...]`**.

### Where ANC lives

Adding an ANC mode means touching all of these, or the surfaces drift apart:

`OpoProtocol` builders · `AncEventParser` (buds→app names) · `LogDecoder` (SET-table log names) ·
`BudsConnectionManager` (`sendAnc*`, `lastAncLevelSent`) · `BudsService` routing ·
`WidgetStateStore` (state + `*IsActive()`) · `AncWidgetProvider` segments ·
`WidgetActionReceiver` · `MainActivity` circles · `AncTileService`.

## UI conventions and traps

- **Theming is attribute-based.** Colours are read from theme attributes during inflation
  (`ThemeRes`), not applied by walking the view tree afterwards. `ThemeRes.select(this)` must run
  **before** `super.onCreate` in every activity.
- **Never add `android:theme` to `<application>` in the manifest.** It makes the framework resolve a
  theme during Activity attach, which breaks `applyOverrideConfiguration()` — the app then crashes
  on launch. Per-activity theming is the only supported path here.
- **Prefs file name lives in one place**: `ThemeRes.PREFS_NAME` (`"QuickBudsPrefs"`). `QuickBudsApp`
  and `DevToolsActivity` used to hardcode the literal — keep all three in sync or prefs split in two.
- **Portrait only, no rotation** — `[USER]` 2026-09-22. Every `<activity>` in the manifest carries
  `android:screenOrientation="portrait"`; there is no `<application>`-level equivalent, so a new
  activity needs the attribute added by hand or it will rotate. No screen in this app has a landscape
  layout, so an allowed rotation would only stretch the portrait one, not show a real design.
- **Widget icon sizing:** `android:width`/`android:height` in a vector must be the **layout** size,
  never the source viewBox. A 1024dp intrinsic size once built 10752px bitmaps → 462 MB →
  "RemoteViews exceeds maximum bitmap memory usage", crashing on connect.
- **Never size these icons with `wrap_content` + `adjustViewBounds`.** Intrinsic size is stored in
  whole pixels at density, so the ratio drifts and the artwork is clipped at the box bounds. Set the
  box explicitly.
- **All icons in a set must share units-per-dp and layout height**, with widths from each icon's own
  ratio. The battery icon misalignment was a **fill fraction** difference (~100% vs ~79%), not an
  aspect-ratio bug — every measured box and ratio was correct.
- **Never put user-visible output on a packet-listener path.** Status events on the main screen are
  silent by design; several call sites fire once per packet and a toast there storms the UI.
- **A `when` on UI string keys with no `else` is a silent-failure generator.** The Transparency bug
  was `"Trans"` vs `"Transparency"` and hid for weeks. Also check for a state write with no matching
  refresh call — that was a widget one-way sync.
- **The download folders are `QuickBudsCrash/`, `QuickBudsLogs/`, `QuickBudsShot/`**, written through
  MediaStore. Do not write to public Downloads with a plain `File` — it is scoped-storage-blocked on
  API 29+, and the failure is silent if the result is not checked.

## Working with the developer

- **He handles device testing and design decisions.** The agent handles reverse-engineering, parsers,
  protocol work and code — and, since the PC move, git operations including commit and push. The
  phone-era rule reserving all git operations for him was a CodeAssist limitation, not a standing
  preference — it does **not** carry forward. **The one thing that does carry forward: ask before
  every push, every time**, whether he says "commit" or the agent proposes it — a standing "yes" to
  push once is not a standing "yes" forever.
- **Revert first, reason after.** When he reports a regression and asks for a revert, do the revert,
  then investigate. Arguing has cost a whole session before.
- **He is the only source of on-device results.** Ask for the specific log line or measurement you
  need; one sentence from him has replaced an entire diagnostic loop.
- **Docs are updated in the same commit as the change**, and protocol changes always land with
  their PROTOCOL.md entry.
- **Do not mark roadmap items with release versions.** Releases happen when he feels the app is
  ready, not on a schedule.

## CodeAssist-era notes — do NOT carry these forward

These were real limits of the old environment only. On PC, with Gradle and a normal source tree,
they are historical:

- `search_text` did not index Markdown, so docs had to be read with the file reader.
- `project_diagnostics` reported **false errors** on nested classes named `Result`/`State`
  (`BatteryParser`, `EarStatusParser`, `WearingStatusParser`, `WidgetStateStore.write`). The build
  was always fine; do not chase these.
- There was no `assemble` task: the only build tasks were `bundle:app:release` and
  `androidRun:app:release`. On PC, use Gradle's own tasks.
- `get_diagnostics` could report "No diagnostics" for a file that did not compile (a missing import
  across packages). After a cross-package change, always run the compiler.
- `noteUnattributed` blanket-excluded cmd `0x0204`, so an undecoded `0x0204` subType printed nothing.
  That hid the ANC push frame for three captures and produced a confident, wrong claim that ANC has
  no push event.

## Dev tools inside the app

`devtool/LayoutReport.kt` writes the laid-out view tree as text — bounds, weights, margins, padding,
gravity, text sizes, and drawable intrinsic vs actual size, plus a `SIBLING GAPS` section. It exists
because a screenshot does not show view ids or exact spacing. **If you change `collectGaps`, keep it
to direct children of each container, measured against that container's own origin and on its own
stacking axis** — two earlier versions broke that and produced confident nonsense. `!! OVERLAP` on
`status_bar_* -> status_text_*` is **by design** (the battery percentage is drawn over the bar).

`devtool/ScreenshotToText.kt` converts a picked screenshot into ascii / grid / colour / rows text.

**Both are slated to be hidden from the UI, with the logic kept** — they may be useful again. Do not
delete them, and do not treat "the agent cannot read images" as a constraint any more.

## Current open items

- **The hold gesture** — finish it. The `0x810C` `02 01` read is now confirmed (2026-09-20, reply
  `0x0007`, see PROTOCOL.md §5); the mask's bit meaning is still inferred, not proven, and the write
  side (`0x0404` `setSupportNoiseReduction`) is untested. Confirm the mask with a membership-change
  test, then the write, then the mode picker.
- **Slide up vs slide down** — both directions are written with the same action because which is
  which is not established.
- **On-call gestures** — to be added for parity (this reverses an earlier "never" decision).
- **Light theme** — either removed or left untouched until the final UI lands. It is the source of
  invisible-on-light bugs. Do not polish it.
- **Case lid state** — keep, remove or change: undecided. `ic_case.xml` stays until then.
- **Auto play/pause on wear** — add the firmware switch, plus our own layer: pause **only when both
  buds are out**, never auto-play.
- **Alert-sound volume slider** — the last remaining "easy parity" row; the rest are in.
- **Localisation** — text is in `strings.xml` but only English exists, and hardcoded strings remain in
  `MainActivity` dialogs, the Dev Tools labels and legend, and `BottomSheetDialog` callers.
- **Undecoded families** — `0x0500`/`0x0501` (they have empty payloads, so they cannot be gesture
  bindings), broadcast codes `0x04`/`0x08`/`0x0B`, the `0x810D` batch-status layout, the recurring
  `F1` family (`AA 0D 00 00 04 02 FF 06 00 F1 01 01 XX YY 02`), and `02 01 08 0C 02` /
  `02 01 07 0B 02` (these carry non-multiples of ten — possibly a fine-grained battery/case field).
  Also `0x0510`, a Spatial Audio notify. **Do not guess any of these from a couple of samples.**
  See PROTOCOL.md §12.

### Connection robustness — known rough edges

From `bluetooth/BudsConnectionManager.kt`. None of these are fixed:

- The **primary UUID `00001107-...` never connects** — it burns a ~5 s timeout on every attempt, and
  the `0000079A-...` fallback is the one that works. **Trying the working UUID first would save 5 s
  per connect.** Not done.
- `Connection reset by peer` / `Broken pipe` appear during long sessions.
- **A 14-minute gap with no reconnect attempt** was observed after `Connection lost`.

## Main screen structure — settled

Header (fixed: device name + dev-tools icon + settings cog) over a `ScrollView` named `mainScroll`.
Inside it, top to bottom:

1. `batteryCard` — full width, halves **equal** (`weight 1 / 1`; they were 0.8 / 1.2 until
   2026-09-17). Left half: `status_bud_left`, a weighted frame holding `status_case_icon` and
   `status_bud_right`. Right half (`marginStart 14dp`): rows `status_row_left` / `status_row_case` /
   `status_row_right`, each a letter `TextView` plus a `ProgressBar` (`status_bar_*`) with a centred
   number `TextView` (`status_text_*`) on top. The numbers are normally empty because
   `SegmentedBarDrawable` draws the value inside the bar; the TextViews are the fallback for a
   non-segmented bar. See `renderBar`.
2. `batteryBarsCard` — the bars only. Splitting it from `batteryCard` was deliberate: as one grid,
   the icon block and the bars fought over the card's height, so resizing icons moved the bars.
3. The ANC switcher — four circles (`anc_btn_off` / `anc_btn_anc` / `anc_btn_adapt` / `anc_btn_trans`).
   Tapping the **active** ANC circle opens the full mode chooser (`showAncChooser`), because four
   buttons cannot represent every mode.
4. `featureList` — the settings card, `@drawable/app_card_outline_bg`, filled at runtime by
   `MainActivity.buildFeatureRows()`. Declared empty in XML on purpose: six near-identical row
   layouts in XML would be six places to edit, and the icons need a themed tint that XML cannot
   apply to a vector drawable. `addRow()` inserts the hairline divider before every row but the first.

**The main screen carries no log**, by design — Dev Tools owns logging. `appendStatus()` only
appends to a bounded in-memory tail. See the note above about not putting user-visible output on a
packet-listener path.

## Widget flow

```
Widget tap
  -> AncWidgetProvider PendingIntent
  -> WidgetActionReceiver
  -> WidgetStateStore.write
  -> broadcast ACTION_WIDGET_COMMAND (short action name)
  -> BudsService.widgetCommandReceiver
  -> executeWidgetCommand
  -> manager.sendAncXxx()
```

The action travels as the **short** name; a full-string-vs-short-name mismatch here was a real bug
(use short names as extras). The send executor was also reworked to a fresh thread per send, because
a shared one hung.

## Settled design decisions — do not re-litigate

- **The battery card is TWO STACKED CARDS**: `batteryCard` holds only the icons, `batteryBarsCard`
  only the bars. An earlier single-card grid was abandoned because the icon block and the bars fought
  over one card's height, so resizing the icons moved the bars.
- **The L / C / R letters stay theme-aware** (`?attr/appColorLetter`). Do not "improve" them into a
  fixed colour.
- **The case icon keeps its LED dot**, and the lid cut stays full width — no hinge bulge or opening.
- **All icons in a set share units-per-dp and layout height**, widths taken from each icon's own true
  ratio. The wear icons are 96dp tall with widths 62 / 124 / 62dp.
- The 2026 icon work is done for the app and the launcher; **the widget preview
  (`drawable/widget_preview_buds.xml`) is a separate copy** and must be updated alongside
  `ic_launcher_foreground.xml`.

## Repo hygiene

- **`local/` holds two folders now**: `logs/` (packet captures cited as evidence by PROTOCOL.md) and
  `svgs/` (the source SVGs the wear icons were traced from, named in the drawables' own headers).
  Both have lasting value and stay tracked. `local/commits/` (the v1.1.0 commit-message files) is
  gone — obsolete once commits started being made on the PC directly.
- **`local/notes/` and `local/NEXT-SESSION.md` are gone, on purpose** — all superseded, and their
  surviving content was folded into this file, PROTOCOL.md, ROADMAP.md and PACKET-CAPTURE.md.
  **Do not recreate a notes folder or a session-plan file.** Scattered per-purpose notes are exactly
  the drift that CLAUDE.md exists to stop — put new durable knowledge here, or in PROTOCOL.md if it
  is about the wire format.
- Runtime `*.log` files written by the app are ignored — they are regenerated every run. Handed-over
  captures (`*.log.txt`) are evidence and **are** tracked.
- There are no committed screenshots.
- Root docs: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `CREDITS.md`, `PACKET-CAPTURE.md`,
  `LICENSE`. The mobile→PC move's two temporary files, `START-HERE.md` and
  `DeepSeek_CodeAssist_memory.md`, served their purpose and are gone — this file is the sole entry
  point for a new session now.
