     * How the wrong number got in, kept because it is the trap:
     *   - `0x0402` was sent repeatedly in a WELL-FORMED frame (`TotalLen 80 = 7 + 73`,
     *     payload `12` + 18x4) and the buds ignored it in total silence: no ack, and the

     *     silently** — "it worked" and "it did nothing" are indistinguishable without
     *     reading the table back, which is why every write re-reads and diffs.
     *   - `0x0401` is what the Melody-derived setting tables list for `setKeyFunction`
     *     (`BtOperate.m2699L`), and those tables run 0x0400, 0x0401, 0x0403, 0x0404 —
     *     0x0402 does not appear among them at all.
     *   - OppoPodsManager mentions 0x0402 only inside a COMMENT on its 0x0108 query line,
     *     and defines no constant for it. An earlier note here took that comment as a table
     *     entry, which is how the wrong number got in — and it cost a session.
     *
     * Payload SHAPE: `<count> [deviceType, button, buttonAction, function]...`, which is

     * ADAPTIVE IS "BIT 11", NOT "BIT 8", AND PASSING 8 WAS A REAL BUG (fixed
     * 2026-09-22). `ancPayload(8)` computes `byteCount = 8/8+1 = 2` and sets bit
     * `8%8 = 0` of the SECOND mask byte, which yields `01 01 00 01` — a different mode

     * 0x0800, whose bit index is 11.
     *
     * State the fix exactly, because "Adaptive is not an index" would be WRONG:
     * `ancPayload(11)` DOES reproduce these bytes — the helper was never the problem,
     * the number handed to it was. 8 is simply the plausible-looking wrong answer,
     * because the vendor's list reads like "0-7, then the next one". Verified against
     * OppoPodsManager `Protocol/OppoProtocol.Anc.cs`, where
     * `AncAdaptive = { 0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x08 }` sits alongside
     * AncSmart/AncLight/AncMedium/AncDeep, all of which our index table reproduces
     * correctly. The bug was inert while nothing called this function; the Adaptive
     * button on the main screen makes it reachable, so it had to be fixed rather than
     * left as a latent wrong packet.
     *
     * QUERY reply / 0x0204 subType 0x03 NOTIFY use bits 3 and 8 instead:

     * Those live in AncEventParser and are deliberately NOT reused here.

     * WARNING / DO NOT REPEAT: this table was briefly "corrected" to the notify

     * NO LEADING STATUS BYTE, unlike the reply. The reply is `<status> <count> ...`
     * (`[CAPTURE]`), but a status byte is something the device REPORTS; a write supplies
     * only the count and its entries.
     *
     * WHY THE CALLER STILL RE-READS: the payload layout above is `[OSS]`, and the ONE
     * thing the device has taught us about this command is that it ignores a wrong
     * command number in total silence (see CMD_SET_KEY_FUNCTION). A silent ignore looks
     * exactly like success unless the table is read back, so the read-back is not
     * belt-and-braces — it is the only evidence there is.
     *
     * LEB128 is safe here: the largest realistic payload is an 18-entry table,
     * `1 + 18*4 = 73` bytes, so `TotalLen = 80` fits in one LEB128 byte. `buildPacket()`
     * would only need real LEB128 above ~30 entries, which this device does not have.
