/**
 * Turns a laid-out view tree into PLAIN TEXT — the numbers, not the pixels.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The agent that works on this project cannot see images. Descriptions of a layout
 * ("the card looks too close to the header") fail because the agent has to guess
 * which of ~30 view ids the description refers to, and a wrong guess costs a build
 * cycle. A screenshot cannot be made readable, but the LAYOUT can: everything a
 * layout bug consists of — x, y, width, height, margins, padding, gravity,
 * weights, text sizes — is already known exactly by the framework at measure /
 * layout time. This class simply writes those numbers out.
 *
 * This is strictly better than an image for the agent's purpose. A pixel grid is
 * at best an approximation of geometry that the framework knows exactly; a text
 * report is exact, cheap, and mentions view ids by name.
 *
 * WHAT IT SOLVES
 *   - "x sits too low / too far right"          -> per-view bounds + gaps
 *   - "these two are not aligned"               -> left/right/top edges side by side
 *   - "the spacing is inconsistent"             -> a gap list, so an outlier is visible
 *   - "this is clipped / off screen"            -> bounds vs parent and vs screen
 *   - "the text is too small / bold is lost"    -> text size and style per TextView
 *   - "the bar is not filling its row"          -> ProgressBar progress and bounds
 *   - "the icon is the wrong size"              -> icon view bounds vs its drawable
 *
 * THE OVERLAY
 * report() writes text. overlay() is the companion for a HUMAN: it burns the view
 * ids straight onto the screen so a screenshot becomes self-describing — every box
 * is labelled with the id it stands for, which removes the guesswork from a
 * screenshot description as well. Both are driven from the same walk.
 *
 * COORDINATES
 * All bounds are in PIXELS (device px) relative to the ROOT view's top-left, so
 * they are directly comparable to each other and to the screen size. dp is given
 * alongside the sizes where a dimension matters, because dp is what the layout XML
 * is written in and therefore what the fix has to be expressed in.

    /**
     * Captures [activity]'s laid-out tree as text and hands it to [onReady],
     * WITHOUT touching the filesystem.
     *
     * This exists because of a design flaw in the first version: the Layout button
     * lives on Dev Tools, and reaching it means leaving the main screen — which
     * pauses MainActivity and clears the `instance` reference the button wanted to
     * report. So the button could only ever describe the screen it was already on,
     * never the screen with the layout problems.
     *
     * The fix is for each screen to capture ITSELF while it is resumed, and park
     * the text somewhere a still-running component can collect. MainActivity calls
     * this in onResume; Dev Tools reads whatever was parked. That way the report
     * always describes the main screen as it was actually laid out on device.

     * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM build(activity):
     * a home-screen widget is not an Activity. It has no window, no decorView, and
     * is drawn by the LAUNCHER — a different process — from a RemoteViews parcel.

     * may be resized by the user, and RemoteViews rewrites some properties — but it
