/**
 * Main screen — rebuilt from scratch against the reference design.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY, in order:
 *   1. The old "status panel" (a capped mirror of the home-screen widget, sitting
 *      in a row with a dead column beside it) is gone. The battery block is now a
 *      full-width card at the top of the scroll, with the L/C/R bars beside the
 *      icons instead of underneath them, and the letters moved into circles.
 *   2. ANC is four circular buttons. Tapping the ACTIVE one opens a chooser with
 *      the full mode list, because four buttons cannot represent five modes and
 *      the request was for a pop-out rather than a fifth circle.
 *   3. The settings rows are a real card with themed switches and chevrons.
 *
 * THEMING
 * Colours come from resources (values/app_colors.xml + the two override folders)
 * and are swapped by ThemeRes.apply() before super.onCreate(). Nothing here sets a
 * raw colour on a view; the only colour work done in code is tinting vector
 * drawables, which cannot be themed from XML.

    /**
     * Renders the three icons using THE WIDGET'S OWN LOGIC, ported verbatim.
     *
     * WHY A PORT RATHER THAN ANOTHER REDESIGN: the app and the widget had drifted
     * into two different icon treatments — different colours, different shapes,
     * different in-case behaviour — and the widget's version is the one that looks
     * right. Reimplementing it here means one source of truth for the rule, and the
     * two surfaces cannot disagree again.
     *
     * The rule, copied from AncWidgetProvider.budStyle():
     *
     *     status 4 or 0   ->  INVISIBLE   (in case)
     *     status 3 or 7   ->  VISIBLE, colourActive  (#FFFFFF, white)
     *     anything else   ->  VISIBLE, colourIdle    (#8A8A8A, grey)
     *
     * COLOURS ARE THE WIDGET'S PALETTE, deliberately, not the app's theme
     * attributes. The user's stated goal is that the panel matches the widget, and
     * the widget is always dark — so white/grey are correct here even on the Light
     * app theme. That is the same reasoning the widget panel used before this
     * redesign, and it is why these two colours are hardcoded rather than themed.
     *
     * The case icon is drawn in the widget's idle/secondary colour and is always
     * visible: the widget has no case icon at all (it labels the bars instead), so
     * there is no widget behaviour to copy for it. Grey is used so it reads as a
     * static reference object rather than competing with the two bud icons.

    /**
     * Tints every vector glyph and restyles the header icon frames.
     *
     * Vectors are the only thing that cannot read a theme from XML: the drawable
     * carries fillColor="#FFFFFF" from its widget usage, so on the light theme it
     * would render white-on-white without an explicit tint. Read through the theme
     * attribute so the tint follows the in-app theme choice.
     *
     * ICONS: uses the WIDGET's bud drawables (ic_bud_left / ic_bud_right), not the
     * _hq variants. The user preferred the widget artwork — its proportions read
     * better — and the _hq re-trace is now unused by the app. It is kept in the
     * tree only because removing it would be an unrelated change.
     *
     * WHY THE EDGES LOOKED PIXELATED, and what fixes it: the widget's drawables
     * declare width/height of 48dp, and drawing one at 52dp (battery card) or
     * 120dp (find my earbuds) makes the platform rasterise the vector at its
     * INTRINSIC size and then BITMAP-SCALE the result up — which is where the
     * blocky edges came from. It is not a fault in the artwork. Setting the bounds
     * explicitly at the target pixel size forces a vector re-rasterisation at that
     * exact size, so the result is anti-aliased and sharp at any scale.
     *
     * That is what setVectorBounds does below. Do not replace it with a plain
