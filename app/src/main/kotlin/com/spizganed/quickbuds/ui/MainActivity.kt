/**
 * Main screen — rebuilt from scratch against the reference design.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY, in order:
 *   1. The old "status panel" (a capped mirror of the home-screen widget, sitting
 *      in a row with a dead column beside it) is gone. The battery block is now a
 *      full-width card at the top of the scroll, with the L/C/R bars beside the
 *      icons instead of underneath them, and the letters moved into circles.
 *   2. ANC is four circular buttons. Tapping the ACTIVE one opens a chooser with
 *      the full mode list, because four buttons cannot represent five modes and
 *      the request was for a pop-out rather than a fifth circle.
 *   3. The settings rows are a real card with themed switches and chevrons.
 *
 * THEMING
 * Colours come from resources (values/app_colors.xml + the two override folders)
 * and are swapped by ThemeRes.apply() before super.onCreate(). Nothing here sets a
 * raw colour on a view; the only colour work done in code is tinting vector
 * drawables, which cannot be themed from XML.

     * right. Reimplementing it here means one source of truth for the rule, and the

     * The rule, copied from AncWidgetProvider.budStyle():
     *
     *     status 4 or 0   ->  INVISIBLE   (in case)
     *     status 3 or 7   ->  VISIBLE, colourActive  (#FFFFFF, white)

     * app theme. That is the same reasoning the widget panel used before this
     * redesign, and it is why these two colours are hardcoded rather than themed.

     * visible: the widget has no case icon at all (it labels the bars instead), so

     * Tints every vector glyph and restyles the header icon frames.
     *
     * Vectors are the only thing that cannot read a theme from XML: the drawable
     * carries fillColor="#FFFFFF" from its widget usage, so on the light theme it
     * would render white-on-white without an explicit tint. Read through the theme
     * attribute so the tint follows the in-app theme choice.
     *
     * ICONS: uses the WIDGET's bud drawables (ic_bud_left / ic_bud_right), not the
     * _hq variants. The user preferred the widget artwork — its proportions read
     * better — and the _hq re-trace is now unused by the app. It is kept in the
     * tree only because removing it would be an unrelated change.
     *
     * WHY THE EDGES LOOKED PIXELATED, and what fixes it: the widget's drawables
     * declare width/height of 48dp, and drawing one at 52dp (battery card) or
     * 120dp (find my earbuds) makes the platform rasterise the vector at its
     * INTRINSIC size and then BITMAP-SCALE the result up — which is where the
     * blocky edges came from. It is not a fault in the artwork. Setting the bounds
     * explicitly at the target pixel size forces a vector re-rasterisation at that
     * exact size, so the result is anti-aliased and sharp at any scale.
     *
     * That is what setVectorBounds does below. Do not replace it with a plain
     * setImageDrawable().

     * widget's white/grey. Whichever ran last won, so the case appeared to change
     * size and colour depending on when a packet happened to arrive, and the buds
     * sometimes showed a stale drawable. All three card icons are now owned solely
     * by renderWear(); do not set them here.
     *
     * The header frames keep the widget's dark chip in EVERY theme (see
