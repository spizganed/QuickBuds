QuickBuds talks to your earbuds directly over a classic Bluetooth RFCOMM channel and undoes
everything the vendor app gets wrong. No HeyMelody, no account, and no root,
Every packet it sends was reverse-engineered and confirmed on
real hardware.(OnePlus Buds 4)

The app was built entirely on a phone (CodeAssist + Termux) using DeepSeek v.4.1-fast through **v1.1.0**. Development has
since moved to a PC with Claude Code.

## Why this exists

Two frustrations with HeyMelody, specifically:

1. **The UI is white-only.** No dark or OLED option.
2. **There is no home-screen widget at all.** Changing any of the features would require to open HeyMelody.

QuickBuds tries to match HeyMelody feature-parity, improves on it and puts a real widget in front of it.
With heavy customization options.

## Where it is going

The goal is **parity with HeyMelody's functionality**, with a better UI and a widget on top. Once
that is matched, this project's own improvements (the widget, the wear-state display) get built on
it. Only after that does support for other earbud models come into scope — other OnePlus / OPPO /
realme models first, since they share the protocol.

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the ordered plan and what is already done.

## Features

**Connection and control**
- Direct RFCOMM to the earbuds (worked UUID `0000079A-D102-11E1-9B23-00025B00A5A5`, tried with fallbacks)
- Full init handshake, then the buds **push** battery, wearing, Game Mode and ANC changes to the
  app — no polling lag
- ANC: Off / Transparency / Adaptive / Light / Medium / Deep / Adaptive 
- Game Mode toggle that also follows bud-side gestures
- Auto-retry connection logic, so a busy earbud does not end the session

**Home-screen widget (4x2)**
- Battery bars for Left / Case / Right, always showing last-known values
- Wear icons that update from the buds' own pushes — milliseconds, not poll-bound
- Bud status: **white** in ear, **grey** out of ear, **hidden** in the case. Those two colours are
  the widget's fixed palette (`#FFFFFF` / `#8A8A8A`), not theme attributes, because the widget is
  always dark
- Six-segment ANC switcher (Off / Trans / Low / Med / High / Adpt) plus a Game Mode row, working
  even with the app closed
- Nothing to configure; it reacts as fast as the hardware reports

**Earbud controls (per-bud gesture bindings)**
- Bind each bud's single / double / triple tap, slide and hold **separately**, because the two buds
  can be configured differently
- Bindings are **written to the earbuds** through a `0x0401` setKeyFunction write, then read back
  and diffed to confirm they took — a wrong command number fails silently, so the read-back is not
  optional
- Tap-and-hold is the one exception and is still incomplete: it is stored as the earbuds' own
  **ANC cycle**, and which modes that cycle contains is not in the key-function table at all. See
  *The ANC hold cycle* below

**App and service**
- Foreground service keeps the link alive. The notification is `IMPORTANCE_MIN` and swipeable;
  Android 15 requires it for a `connectedDevice` service, so it cannot be removed
- Quick Settings tile
- OLED Black and Dark themes. A Light theme still exists but is unmaintained — it is the source of
  several invisible-on-light bugs (white L/C/R letters), and it will either be removed or left
  untouched until the final UI lands
- Main screen: a battery card, the ANC switcher — four circles (Off / ANC / Adaptive /
  Transparency), where tapping ANC opens the Low/Medium/High chooser — and a settings card holding
  Game Mode (live), Hi-Res codec, spatial audio, Equalizer, Find my earbuds, Earbud controls and
  App update
- Dedicated screens: **Dev Tools**, **Equalizer**, **Find my earbuds**, **Earbud controls**,
  **App update**
- Dialogs are the app's own **bottom sheets**, so the theme picker, the ANC chooser and the gesture
  picker match the app's palette instead of the platform's

**Diagnostics**
- Packet logging: every sent command and every received frame, timestamped
- Dev Tools screen with a human-readable log and a raw-hex log, hold-to-copy, Mark / Clear /
  export-to-file, and Reconnect / Disconnect
- A **layout report** tool that dumps the measured view tree as text, and a **Screen** tool that
  turns a picked screenshot into ASCII / grid / colour / rows text. Both are currently slated to be
  hidden from the UI rather than deleted

> The main screen carries **no** log. Dev Tools owns logging; status events on the main screen are
> silent by design, because a toast on a packet-listener path storms the UI.

## How it works

                              OpoProtocol: handshake, queries, the 0x0205 event

**The protocol is documented end to end in [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md)** — frame layout, every
command, the ANC tables, gestures, and the mistakes already made. Read it before touching anything
protocol-related. A few facts worth knowing up front, because each one cost real time:

- Battery is query `0x0106`; wearing is query `0x0109`. (These were written as `0x01F0`/`0x01F2`
  for a long time, which is wrong — those are the command byte welded to its sequence value.)
- `0x0205` makes the buds push `0x0204` events. Its payload is a **count** byte followed by event
  ids, and getting that shape wrong fails silently: `01 01 02 02` reads as "count=1, battery only",
  so wear events never arrive. The app sends `03 01 02 03` — battery, wearing **and ANC**; dropping
  `03` is what made bud-side ANC gestures look silent for three captures.
- **The SET and NOTIFY encodings for ANC are different tables** and are not supposed to agree.
  Setting uses bit 0 = Off and bit 2 = Transparency; the buds *report* Off as bit 3 and
  Transparency as bit 8.
- **Adaptive's SET mask is `0x0800` (bit 11), not bit 8.** The build passed `8` once and sent
  `01 01 00 01`, a *different mode*. Its payload is `01 01 00 08`.
- Closing the lid with the buds docked kills the RFCOMM socket, and that is used as a lid signal.

### The ANC hold cycle

Tap-and-hold is bound to a single "ANC cycle" function, and that is all the key-function table
stores — no membership, no mode list. The developer bound the hold to two modes once and four
another time, and the stored byte was `0x08` both times; clearing it to `0x00` did not stop the
cycle either.

That does not make the mode list unreachable. The buds hold a *changeable* list, and the protocol
exposes it through a different command — `setSupportNoiseReduction` (`0x0404`, payload
`[action=2][noiseType][modeMask LE]`), read back with `0x010C` payloads `02 01` / `02 03` / `02 04`.
The app currently only *sends the read*; nothing writes it yet, and no capture has ever shown a
`0x810C` answer to `02 01`, so the reply's shape is unknown. Confirming that read on the device is
the next step — see [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) §5 and [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## Requirements and tested setup

- Android, developed and tested on a **Nothing Phone (3a) running Android 15**
- **OnePlus Buds 4**, firmware `B4.1-260810-1153`. Other OnePlus / OPPO / realme buds likely work,
  since the protocol is shared, but they are untested
- The earbuds must already be paired in system Bluetooth settings — the app connects to paired
  buds, it does not pair them for you

### The protocol was reverse-engineered by others first

The OPPO / OnePlus / realme earbud protocol was never publicly documented. Everything this project
knows about it stands on people who worked it out first and published their results:

| Project | What we owe it |
| --- | --- |
| [**Zhaoyi-ya/OppoPodsManager**](https://github.com/Zhaoyi-ya/OppoPodsManager) | The single biggest source. Frame layout and LEB128 length encoding, most of the command table, the ANC set and notify tables, the key-function entry shape, feature IDs. |
| [**Star-ZER0/Pods-Protocol-Reverse-Engineering**](https://github.com/Star-ZER0/Pods-Protocol-Reverse-Engineering) | Independent confirmation of the framing, and the broadcast-codes idea that proved our ANC subscription fix was right. (CC-BY-SA-4.0 — documentation only.) |
| [Leaf-lsgtky/OppoPods](https://github.com/Leaf-lsgtky/OppoPods) | Early OPPO earbud protocol work; origin of some of the framing knowledge. |
| [Zhaoyi-ya/OPPO-Pods-Win](https://github.com/Zhaoyi-ya/OPPO-Pods-Win) | Cross-check on which features exist per device model. |
| [ORION2809/DevPods](https://github.com/ORION2809/DevPods) | A second implementation of the same vendor family; useful for cross-checking. |

Sibling projects solving the same problem for other brands — not sources for our protocol, but
worth knowing: [elaxptr/baseus-desktop](https://github.com/elaxptr/baseus-desktop), a Windows client
for Baseus earbuds.

### How this was actually built

- The project **started on DeepSeek chat** — the first codebase, the first reverse-engineering
  steps, the basic UI, packet logger and a basic ANC-button widget. **That first widget was later
  rewritten almost entirely**; treat the early history as scaffolding.
- It then moved to the **CodeAssist agent, via OpenRouter, running DeepSeek v4.1-fast**, which wrote
  roughly **80%** of what is here now. DeepSeek chat accounts for about **15%**; Kimi, Gemini (image
  generation) and Grok did the remaining small tasks.
- From **v1.1.0 and the last commit of that era onward**, development moved to a PC and to
  **Claude Code**, which is where the work continues.
- **Everything that was not DeepSeek run on free tiers.** 

Every model involved reasoned about protocol bytes captured on real hardware. The captures and the
on-device testing are what make the claims in [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) checkable, and they are
the part a language model cannot supply on its own.

### Tools
