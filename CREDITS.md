# Credits and protocol sources

QuickBuds is a clean-room Android client for the OPPO / OnePlus / realme earbud
RFCOMM protocol. None of the protocol knowledge here was documented by the
vendor. It exists because other people reverse-engineered it first and published
their results. This file records exactly whose work we rely on, and for what, so
the debt is never lost.

**If you add a protocol constant, frame layout, or event mapping to this project,
add its source here in the same commit.**

> **See also [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md)** — the wire format itself, with every
> claim tagged `[VENDOR]` / `[OSS]` / `[CAPTURE]` / `[GUESS]` so it is always clear
> which parts are sourced and which are still guesses.

## Primary sources

### Zhaoyi-ya/OppoPodsManager — the main reference
https://github.com/Zhaoyi-ya/OppoPodsManager

A desktop (Windows/Linux) manager for OPPO/OnePlus/realme earbuds. This is the
single most detailed public reference for this protocol, and it is where most of
our command table comes from.

What we use from it:

| Area | What it gave us |
|------|-----------------|
| Frame layout | `AA <TotalLen> 00 00 <Cmd LE> <Seq> <PayLen LE> <Payload>`, and the LEB128 length encoding |
| Command table | The 0x01xx query / 0x81xx response / 0x02xx broadcast / 0x04xx set layout — `CmdSetAnc=0x0404`, `CmdQueryAnc=0x010C`, `CmdActiveReport=0x0204`, `CmdRegisterNotify=0x0205`, `CmdQueryFunctionKey=0x0108`. **Exception: their `CmdSetKeyFunction=0x0402` is WRONG** — the real write is `0x0401`, and `0x0402` is ignored in total silence. See the *Key function* row below |
| ANC (set) | `Protocol/OppoProtocol.Anc.cs` — the `AncOff/AncLight/AncMedium/AncDeep/AncTransparency` payloads and `PktAncByIndex()`, which is the exact bitmask algorithm in our `OpoProtocol.ancPayload()` |
| ANC (notify) | `AncValues` — the `(Val1, Val2) -> name` dictionary for the 0x0204 subType 0x03 push, which matches our own captures exactly and is the basis of `AncEventParser.modeForRaw()` |
| Button/gesture | `Models/UserInteractionEventInfo.cs` — the 0x0204 subType 0xF1 payload body (side, button, action, modifier, context, int16 options) and the action names (0x00 single, 0x02 double, 0x03 triple, 0x04 long press, 0x07 slide up, 0x08 slide down) |
| Key function | `Models/KeyFunctionItem.cs` — the **4-byte entry** `[deviceType, button, buttonAction, function]` shared by `getKeyFunction` (0x0108) and `setKeyFunction`. That field order is confirmed by our own `0x8108` capture (PROTOCOL.md §6), so `ENTRY_SIZE = 4` is `[OSS]`+`[CAPTURE]`. **The file does NOT model the payload around an entry, and we initially over-trusted it TWICE:** the real reply begins `<status> <count>`, and reading `payload[0]` as the count cost us an off-by-one that printed `!LAYOUT`; and the write command it implies — `CmdSetKeyFunction = 0x0402` — is **wrong**, which cost a second session. Both corrections are OUR findings (`[CAPTURE]`). Credit for the entry, not the envelope or the command number. The `function` byte's *values* are not in that file either — we measured them ourselves |
| Feature IDs | `Protocol/OppoProtocol.Features.cs` — the `FeatureXxx` constants for the generic 0x0403 feature switch, including `FeatureSpatial=0x1B`, `FeatureDualDevice=0x11`, `FeatureGameLL=0x06`, `FeatureGameMain=0x28` |
| Wearing / in-case | The 0x0109 wearing query and its `[count][component,status]` pairs |

Their work is derived in part from the Melody (HeyMelody) Android APK, which they
cite as `melody 16.8.1` and reference by obfuscated class where relevant.

### Leaf-lsgtky/OppoPods
https://github.com/Leaf-lsgtky/OppoPods

Early OPPO earbud private-protocol reverse engineering. Credited by
OppoPodsManager as a source for the protocol work, and the origin of some of the
framing knowledge.

### Star-ZER0/Pods-Protocol-Reverse-Engineering
https://github.com/Star-ZER0/Pods-Protocol-Reverse-Engineering

Reverse-engineering notes for OPPO, vivo and Moondrop earbuds. Its `handmade/`
folder (hand-made, higher confidence) and `ai-generated/` folder (clearly marked
as lower confidence) are separated, which is a convention worth copying.

What we use from it:

| Area | What it gave us |
|------|-----------------|
| Frame layout | Independent confirmation of the header, reserved bytes, LE cmd, seq, LE payload length |
| LEB128 length | The `TotalLen` encoding rule, including the `>=128` case: subtract 1, then standard LEB128, and the inverse on decode |
| Broadcast codes | That the 0x8200 reply lists the supported broadcast codes, and that `0x03` is the ANC/noise-mode broadcast. **This is what proved our ANC subscription fix was correct.** |
| ANC (query) | The query reply values: `0x0008` Off, `0x0010` ANC on, `0x0100` Transparency, and the separate adaptive value |
| Battery frame | `01LL02RR03MM` with bit 7 of each byte as the charging flag |

### Zhaoyi-ya/OPPO-Pods-Win
https://github.com/Zhaoyi-ya/OPPO-Pods-Win

The packaged Windows product from the same author as OppoPodsManager. Useful as
a cross-check on which features are exposed per device model, and on the
capability-per-model idea (a device does not support every command).

### ORION2809/DevPods
https://github.com/ORION2809/DevPods

Turns earbuds into a developer control surface, with a multi-provider mesh that
includes an OPPO/Realme/OnePlus provider. Useful as a second implementation of
the same vendor family, and for its `protocol/` and `docs/` folders.

## What is ORIGINAL to this project

To keep the credits honest, these are our own captures and findings, not taken
from anyone else:

- The **ANC gesture push** mapping for OnePlus Buds 4 (firmware
  `B4.1-260810-1153`), captured on-device: `0x0008` Off, `0x0002` ANC (generic),
  `0x0080` Smart, `0x0040` Light, `0x0020` Medium, `0x0010` Deep, `0x0100`
  Transparency, `0x0200` Transparency with voice enhance, `0x0800` Adaptive —
  and the finding that the ANC-on stop **echoes the last level**, so the value is a
  bitmask rather than a fixed enum. (`AncEventParser.modeForRaw()` is the
  implementation; PROTOCOL.md §5 has the table.)
- The observation that the **SET and NOTIFY ANC encodings differ** (set uses bit
  0 for Off and bit 2 for Transparency; the buds report bits 3 and 8). This is a
  genuine trap and is documented in `OpoProtocol.ancPayload()`.
- The working `0x0205` registration payload shape for this device, and the fact
  that `0x03` must be included to receive ANC pushes at all.
- **The gesture write command is `0x0401`, not `0x0402`.** Both public sources were
  `[OSS]` and disagreed; `0x0402` was tried and the buds **ignored it in total
  silence** (no ack, table unchanged), while `0x0401` is acked immediately
  (`RX AA 08 00 00 01 84 .. 01 00 00`, payload `00` = success). Settled on the
  device — see PROTOCOL.md §6.
- **The `function` enum's values**, measured by diffing two `0x8108` readings
  around changes made in the vendor app and checking every value against what was
  actually bound: `0x00` none, `0x01` play/pause, `0x03` voice assistant,
  `0x05` prev, `0x06` next, `0x07` volume, `0x08` ANC cycle, `0x0A` switch track,
  `0x11` game mode.
- **The `0x8108` reply's table shape is not fixed** (18 entries then 20), and
  **slide occupies its own `button` groups `0x02`/`0x03`** — when its slots moved
  out of `0x01`, writes aimed at `0x01` silently did nothing.
- **F1 `byte2`/`byte3` are the key-function `act`/`function` pair** (PROTOCOL.md
  §6.1), matched across five slots.
- **The hold's function byte does not control the ANC cycle** — clearing it to
  `0x00` did not stop the gesture. Its mode list belongs to the separate
  `setSupportNoiseReduction` (`0x0404`).
- **`ancAdaptive()` was sending the wrong payload: Adaptive is bit 11, not bit 8.**
  We passed `8` to our own index helper, which produced `01 01 00 01` — a different
  mode. The real payload is `01 01 00 08` (mask `0x0800`, little endian after the
  `01 01` prefix). Corrected against `OppoPodsManager`'s literal `AncAdaptive`, which
  our table had otherwise reproduced correctly — so this is a bug in OUR derivation of
  Adaptive, not in their table. `ancPayload(11)` would produce the right bytes; the
  builder spells them literally anyway so the mask never has to be re-derived.
  Fixed and marked in PROTOCOL.md §5.
- Everything in the Android UI layer: the widget, the layout, the theme system,
  the LayoutReport dev tool, and the `KEYFN DIFF:` binding-diff tool.
- **The hold's ANC-cycle mask (`setSupportNoiseReduction`, `0x0404` action `02`) is the same
  bit numbering as `ancPayload()`**, captured 2026-09-22 via an HCI capture of HeyMelody itself
  adding Adaptive to a hold cycle: the mask moved `0x0007 -> 0x0807`, and bit 11 is exactly
  Adaptive's bit in the plain SET table. Write, ack and read-back all confirmed in the same
  capture. `[OSS]` only named the payload shape (`[action][type][mask LE]`); the bit numbering
  and the fact it works at all are ours.
- **The on-call group (`btn 0x06`) write shape**, from the same capture session: single-entry
  `setKeyFunction` writes, `deviceType 0x04` meaning "both buds" (a value not documented
  anywhere, `[OSS]` or otherwise), `act 0x02`/`0x06` toggling `fn 0x00`/`0x1D`/`0x1C`. See
  PROTOCOL.md §6.

## Errata / things that were wrong

Recorded on purpose, because a future session will otherwise re-derive them:

- The 0x0205 register payload `01 01 02 02` seen in older notes is a **misread**.
  Under the count-first shape it means "count=1, register battery only", which the
  firmware accepts while silently never sending wear events.
- The comment in an earlier revision of `GameModeParser` claiming "ANC changes
  raise no 0x0204 event" is **false**. ANC uses subType `0x03`; game mode uses
  `0x05`.
- The SET_ANC bit table was briefly "corrected" to the notify bit numbers on the
  theory that set and query must agree. **They do not.** That change was reverted.
- Adaptive was stored as **bit index 8** in the SET table, which `ancPayload()`
  renders as `01 01 00 01` — a different mode. The real payload is `01 01 00 08`,
  i.e. mask `0x0800`, whose bit index is **11**. The mistake was assuming the vendor's
  list was one-bit-per-mode with no gaps, so "Adaptive comes after Smart (bit 7)" was
  taken to mean index 8; bits 8-10 are in fact unused. Careless in one more way: an
  earlier revision of PROTOCOL.md then over-corrected to "Adaptive cannot be expressed
  as a bit index at all", which is also false. **Derive the index from the mask, never
  from the mode's position in a list.** The same misreading existed in `LogDecoder`,
  which looked for `0x0100` and so would have printed our own corrected Adaptive
  command as `Unknown (0x0800)`. Both fixed 2026-09-22.
- The command numbers in an earlier revision of README.md's protocol notes were
  written as **`0x01F0`** (battery) and **`0x01F2`** (wearing). Those commands do
  not exist: they are the command byte welded onto the SEQ value the app happens to
  send. The real numbers are **`0x0106`** and **`0x0109`**. Anything grepping a log
  for `0x01F0` finds nothing. Corrected 2026-09-22.
- The README described the widget as **3x2**; `xml/widget_anc_info.xml` declares
  **4x2** (`targetCellWidth=4`). Corrected 2026-09-22.
